# Muzi is a mobile first theme for your Jekyll/GitHub Pages website

## [Add it](/customize/) to your site today!

## Kramdown flavored Markdown comes as standard

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~. You can link to stuff such as our [customization guide](/customize/).

Paragraphs are automatically created. Just seperate text by a blank line!

> This is a blockquote
>
> 井の中の蛙大海を知らず
>
> A frog in a well does not know the great ocean


## Flowtext & other cool things

Muzi automatically scales text based on the size of you screen for easier reading (_Shhhh we stole this from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/typography.html#flow) but its MIT licensed so its fine_)

Muzi comes with a 404 page for things that [don't exist](/this-doesnt-exist) and a built-in post [indexing widget](/customize/#6-cookie-consent).

SEO stuff is all taken care of with the [Jekyll SEO tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)

Serving cookies? Just enable this in [_config.yml](/customize/#6-cookie-consent)  
Analytics? Just [give us](/customize/#7-google-analytics) your tracking id and we'll get it sorted!

## Some other markdown demos

```js
// Code highlighting uses the Monokai theme.
function haveFun(friends) {
  return friends.map(friend => friend.enterPartyMode())
}
```
